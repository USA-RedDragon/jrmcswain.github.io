## Welcome to Ban-Fireworks.com

The idea is to bring together all interested parties to help ban firework sales to private citizens. Be a repository for information to help citizens get legislation introduced to ban the sale of fireworks in their state.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### WHY?

I am glad you asked, there are actualy very good reasons for this:


- Bulleted
- List

1. The sudden and loud noises are a constant source of agitation for our veterans with PTSD.

2. Many wild and domestic animals are driven into a flight state and have injured themselves trying to flee the noise.

3. The World Health organization is concerned that the noise is over 120 decibels, that is considered the pain threshold for humans and also lead to permanent hearing loss.

4. Lead and other chemicals released into the air, cause breathing difficulties for individuals with asthma,COPD, lung cancer etc. As well as the polution it creates.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jrmcswain/jrmcswain.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
